In this project, we are going to use webcam and will take a picture of the person who is in front of the webcam and will check whether that person’s record exist in our wanted people’s list or not. 
There will be some pictures already stored in our database.
This is an image processing project in which scans the face of a person using the webcam, identify different pattern of a person’s face and will match the facial features with some pictures of wanted people and will detect that whether this person is in wanted list or not.
